# E-comerce-system

This project is about building the back end for an e-commerce site. This application used Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application creates a database using mySQL with models and associations. API Routes are derived to perform RESTful CRUD operations using sequelized models and the same is being tested in Insomnia
We’ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application won’t be deployed so i’ll show a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.
